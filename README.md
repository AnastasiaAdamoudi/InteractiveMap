# Light A Beacon

A website to introduce an upcoming retreat, to capture its unique characteristics and offerings. Created for Campfire Network.

### The challenge:
Create a web app that allows users to login and create "beacons", as well as join other members' beacons. Show all the beacons on a map.

### My solution:
A responsive and accessible full-stack app with authentication functionality and an integrated map to display the beacons created by the users.


## Website Link

The website isn't live yet - the project is under construction.



## Roadmap

- Finish the development of the React App, so that everything is connected to the server functionality.
- Finish the styling of the frontend.
- Deploy the website.


## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```bash
$ npm -v && node -v
```


## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install my-project with npm:

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```



    
## Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone (https://github.com/AnastasiaAdamoudi/InteractiveMap)
```

There is a Node.js server connected with the app. I recommend starting the server before starting the client.

To start the server, go to to the project directory:

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Go to the server directory:

```bash
  cd server
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
  npm start
```

The server will start on your local machine on port 3000. It won't connect to the MongoDB database as its details are on an .env file on my local machine. To use the server along with a MongoDB database, you could create your own database and use its details on your own .env file.

To start the client and view the project on your browser, go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Go to the client directory:

```bash
  cd interactive-map-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server to run the client:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Open the local host link that is displayed on your terminal to view the client on your browser.
